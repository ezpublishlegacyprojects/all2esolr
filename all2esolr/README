INSTALLATION
============

(1)  Extract the extension into your extension folder ex:"ezrootdir/extensions"

(3)  Activate the extension by adding the following lines to your
     siteaccess settings "settings/override/site.ini.append.php":

     [ExtensionSettings]
     ActiveExtensions[]=all2esolr
     
     Remember to clear the cache files after activating the extension.

CONFIGURATION
=============

To activate the workflow make the following steps in your admin siteaccess:

(1)  Create a workflow.
     Choose a workflow group or create a new on under /workflow/grouplist
     Klick on the button New Workflow. Choose a name like "index after move".
     Add the event "Event/re-index node after being moved"
     and save that workflow.

(2)  Activate the workflow.
     At /trigger/list is a new entry named "content move after".
     Select the new crated workflow and apply changes.

(optional) You may possibly have already added a different workflow to the
     trigger content move after.
     In that case you need to use a Multiplexer to handle multiple workflows
     on one trigger. Please read the documentation to do so.
